       <!-- firstFunction();  This gets executed in execution phase but is out of the containing scope 
    of the script tag. So function is not called as creation phase only hoists the functions 
    to the top of the script tag( within script)-->

        <script>
    //  firstFunction(); 
    //  This works even though it is given before the function declaration because -
    //  When JavaScript code is executed, it goes through two main phases: 
    //  the creation phase and the execution phase.
    //  1. Creation Phase: In this phase, JavaScript sets up the environment, including 
    // creating variable objects, function declarations, and assigning memory space to variables 
    // and functions. During this phase, all function declarations are hoisted to the top of their
    //  containing scope. This means that JavaScript "hoists" (moves) the function declarations to 
    //  the top of the code, making them accessible throughout the entire scope.
    //  2. Execution Phase: In this phase, the code is executed line by line, from top to bottom.

    document.getElementById("btn").onclick=firstFunction;
    // if paranthesis is used after function name in this way of implementing onclick, The browser
    // doesn't wait for onclick to be called, rather executes the function before that. 
    //  calling the function only works inside the script itself
     function firstFunction(){
        alert("First function is called");
     }
        </script>
